I am a PhD Candidate at the **Department of Political Economy, King's College London**. I will be joining the Technical University of Munich as a Postdoctoral Fellow starting September 2024.

My research interests are broadly in the field of development economics. I have a particular interest in understanding the causes and effects of structural transformation in developing countries, and how this interacts with gender equality. I am also interested in researching questions concerning health, behaviour, and trade.
