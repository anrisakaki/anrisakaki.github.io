I am a PhD Candidate at the **Department of Political Economy, King's College London**.

My research interests are broadly in the field of development economics. I have a particular interest in understanding the causes and effects of structural transformation in developing countries, and how this interacts with gender equality. I am also interested in researching questions concerning human capital, behaviour, and trade.  

I am on the job market. 

Feel free to get in touch with me at: anri.sakakibara@kcl.ac.uk
