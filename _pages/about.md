I am a PhD Candidate at the **Department of Political Economy, King's College London**. 

My research interests are broadly in the field of development economics. I have a particulary interest in the causes and effects of structural transformation in developing countries, and how this interacts with gender equality. I am also interested in researching questions concerning human capital, behaviour, and trade in developing countries.  

Feel free to get in touch with me at: anri.sakakibara@kcl.ac.uk 

### Research interests: 

* Development
* Labour
* Gender
