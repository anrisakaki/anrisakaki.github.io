I am a Postdoctoral Follow at the Department of Economics, Technical University of Munich. I obtained my PhD in Economics from the Department of Political Economy, King's College London. 

My research interests are broadly in the field of development economics. I have a particular interest in understanding the causes and effects of structural transformation in developing countries, and how this interacts with gender equality. I am also interested in researching questions concerning health, behaviour, and trade.
