### Trade-induced Structural Transformation and Household-level Inequality: Lessons from Vietnam 
<details>  
<summary> Abstract </summary>

There is little consensus on whether access to foreign export markets can promote gender equality in developing countries. This paper leverages the US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) that came into force in 2001 as a natural experiment to explore whether the disproportionate expansion of the female-intensive wearing apparel sector can trigger the structural transformation of the female labour force in a way which promotes gender equality at the household level. By using a difference-in-differences strategy and through relying on panel data, I find that women residing in provinces that were more exposed to the BTA were more likely to work in the wearing apparel sector and increased their income relative to their husbands. I then examine whether the improvement in labour market opportunities and relative income of women led to changes in the allocation of resources that could be indicative of higher female intrahousehold bargaining power. I find that household consumption of `female-preferred' goods did not increase in provinces that experienced more exposure to the BTA.

### Trade Policy and Jobs in Vietnam: The Unintended Consequences of Trump’s Trade War

<summary> Abstract </summary>

We use the US-China trade war as an exogenous shock to export opportunities in Vietnam and examine its effect on Vietnam’s exports and labor markets. We find that Vietnamese exports to the US were around 40 percent higher in 2020 relative to 2017 in sectors hit by US tariffs on Chinese products. This increase is driven by both new export product varieties and increased exports in existing categories. This expansion in export opportunities led to job creation and increased working hours in affected sectors relative to non-affected ones. It also led to an increase in wages, even more so for women workers.

### The Effect of the Vietnam War on Female Labour Market Outcomes
<summary> Abstract </summary>
War-induced demographic shocks have been shown to increase female labour force participation (FLFP). However, it is unclear as to whether these effects are long-lasting. Additionally, existing evidence predominantly stems from developed nations, which may not fully capture the dynamics in developing contexts due to differing levels of economic development and institutional frameworks. To explore the effect of conflict on female labour market outcomes in developing countries, this paper examines the impact of the Vietnam War 26 to 43 years after its conclusion. I leverage an OLS and difference-in-differences empirical strategy, and match comprehensive historical data on ordnance deployed by the United States in Vietnam to microdata and find that exposure to ordnance increased the probability of women in the South. Going from the 1st to 3rd quantile in exposure to ordnance increases the probability of women in the South working by 6 to 12 percentage points. I also find that this effect is persistent until present day. On the other hand, I find no effect of exposure to ordnance on Northern women, and all men throughout Vietnam. I further explore whether an increase in FLFP was driven by higher demand for female labour due to a shortage in male workers. Using the Vietnam Enterprise Census, I conclude that female labour supply increased without concomitant increase in demand as firms located in provinces that experienced higher exposure in ordnance did not exhibit a lower ratio of male to female workers.
