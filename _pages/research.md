### Trade-induced structural transformation and household-level inequality: Lessons from Vietnam (JMP)

<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>

There is little consensus on whether access to foreign export markets can promote gender equality in developing countries. This paper leverages the US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) that came into force in 2001 as a natural experiment to explore whether the disproportionate expansion of the female-intensive wearing apparel sector can trigger the structural transformation of the female labour force in a way which promotes gender equality at the household level. By using a difference-in-differences strategy and through relying on panel data, I find that women residing in provinces that were more exposed to the BTA were more likely to work in the wearing apparel sector and increased their income relative to their husbands. I then examine whether the improvement in labour market opportunities and relative income of women led to changes in the allocation of resources that could be indicative of higher female intrahousehold bargaining power. I find that household consumption of `female-preferred' goods did not increase in provinces that experienced more exposure to the BTA.

<summary> Abstract </summary>

We use the US-China trade war as an exogenous shock to export opportunities in Vietnam and examine its effect on Vietnam’s exports and labor markets. We find that Vietnamese exports to the US were around 40 percent higher in 2020 relative to 2017 in sectors hit by US tariffs on Chinese products. This increase is driven by both new export product varieties and increased exports in existing categories. This expansion in export opportunities led to job creation and increased working hours in affected sectors relative to non-affected ones. It also led to an increase in wages, even more so for women workers.
