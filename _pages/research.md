### Trade-induced structural transformation and household-level inequality: Lessons from Vietnam (JMP)

<details>
<summary> Abstract </summary>

Much is understood about how trade affects gender inequality in terms of labour force participation and wages at the firm and sector level. However, how trade affects gender inequality at the household-level is an under explored area of research. This paper uses the US-Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) that came into force in 2001 to explore how the disproportionate expansion of female-intensive sectors can trigger the structural transformation of the female labour force, and how this affects women's share of contribution to the total household income. By using a panel of households from the Vietnam Household Living Standards Survey and through exploiting provincial variation in exposure to the BTA, I find that women increased their contribution to the total household income by 10.8 percentage points in the 4 years following the implementation of the trade agreement. I then examine whether the closing of the spousal household contribution gap led to changes in the allocation of household resources that could be indicative of higher female intrahousehold bargaining power, and find that household consumption of 'female-preferred' goods did not increase.

<summary> Abstract </summary>

We use the US-China trade war as an exogenous shock to export opportunities in Vietnam and examine its effect on Vietnam’s exports and labor markets. We find that Vietnamese exports to the US were around 40 percent higher in 2020 relative to 2017 in sectors hit by US tariffs on Chinese products. This increase is driven by both new export product varieties and increased exports in existing categories. This expansion in export opportunities led to job creation and increased working hours in affected sectors relative to non-affected ones. It also led to an increase in wages, even more so for women workers.
