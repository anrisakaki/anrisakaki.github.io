<summary><strong>🔍 Abstract</strong></summary>

We use the US–China trade war as an exogenous shock to export opportunities in Vietnam and examine its effect on Vietnam’s exports and labor markets. We find that Vietnamese exports to the US were around 40 percent higher in 2020 relative to 2017 in sectors hit by US tariffs on Chinese products. This increase is driven by both new export product varieties and increased exports in existing categories. This expansion in export opportunities led to job creation and increased working hours in affected sectors relative to non-affected ones. It also led to an increase in wages, even more so for women workers.

### **Trade-induced Structural Transformation and Household-level Inequality: Lessons from Vietnam**  
🎓 *Funded by STEG PhD Grant*

<summary><strong>🔍 Abstract</strong></summary>

There is little consensus on whether access to foreign export markets can promote gender equality in developing countries. This paper leverages the US–Vietnam Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) that came into force in 2001 as a natural experiment to explore whether the disproportionate expansion of the female-intensive wearing apparel sector can trigger the structural transformation of the female labour force in a way that promotes gender equality at the household level. Using a difference-in-differences strategy and panel data, I find that women residing in provinces more exposed to the BTA were more likely to work in the wearing apparel sector and increased their income relative to their husbands. I then examine whether improvements in women's labour market opportunities and relative income affected the allocation of household resources in ways indicative of higher female intrahousehold bargaining power. I find that household consumption of “female-preferred” goods did not increase in provinces that experienced higher exposure to the BTA.

### **The Effect of the Vietnam War on Female Labour Market Outcomes**  
📤 *Under review*

<details>
<summary><strong>🔍 Abstract</strong></summary>

War results in demographic shocks and sex imbalances, both of which have been shown to increase female labour force participation (FLFP). Existing evidence on the nexus between conflict and FLFP predominantly stems from developed nations, which may not fully capture dynamics in developing contexts. This paper examines the impact of the Vietnam War on Vietnamese women’s labour market outcomes 14 to 44 years after its conclusion. Using comprehensive historical data on ordnance deployed by the United States in Vietnam matched to microdata, I find that while socialist ideology may have contributed to high FLFP rates in North Vietnam, war-induced demographic shocks contributed to increased FLFP rates in South Vietnam. A one-standard-deviation increase in historical bombing exposure is associated with a 1.03 to 1.57 percentage-point higher probability of Southern women working. In contrast, exposure to the Vietnam War is not associated with FLFP outcomes in the North. Evidence suggests that war widows increased their labour supply to compensate for income loss due to the death of their husbands, and daughters of widows are more likely to work than daughters of non-widows. However, I find limited support for demand-side mechanisms such as substitution toward female labour.
